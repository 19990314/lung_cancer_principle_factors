Lung Cancer Principle Factors

This README file introduces the pipeline of analyzing the principle factors influencing the pathology of lung cancer cases, in order to build a deep learning network which considers the global features to make clinical decisions, such as prescription and prognosis. Past studies have done great work in this area, whereas the aim of this study is to focus on upgrading the precision and accuracy by comprehensively correlated features, which could explain tumor growth based on hierachical data from multi-omic biomarkers and patients' health records.
