Lung Cancer Principle Factors

This README file introduces the pipeline of analyzing the principle factors influencing the pathology of lung cancer cases, in order to build a deep learning network which considers the global features to make clinical decisions, such as prescription and prognosis. Past studies have done great work in this area, whereas the aim of this study is to focus on upgrading the precision and accuracy by comprehensively correlated features, which could explain tumor growth based on hierachical data from multi-omic biomarkers and patients' health records.

Note:
The 33591 gene sets in the Human Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) are divided into 9 major collections, which in this project, we are using 3 of them as cancer-related gene sets.
C3: regulatory target gene sets - TFT: transcription factor targets
Contains: 1115 gene sets
Description: All transcription factor target prediction gene sets. Combined superset of both GTRD prediction methods and legacy sets.

C5: ontology gene sets
Contains: 15937 gene sets
Description: Gene sets that contain genes annotated by the same ontology term. The C5 collection is divided into two subcollections, the first derived from the Gene Ontology resource (GO) which contains BP, CC, and MF components and a second derived from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO).

C6: oncogenic signature gene sets
Contains: 189 gene sets
Description: Gene sets that represent signatures of cellular pathways which are often dis-regulated in cancer. The majority of signatures were generated directly from microarray data from NCBI GEO or from internal unpublished profiling experiments involving perturbation of known cancer genes.
